# Lisette — screen specifications

Status: **proposal for review.** Derives screens and their appearance from `requirements.md` and the functional design spec (`../superpowers/specs/2026-10-17-lisette-functional-design.md`), and applies `../../brand/identity.md` and `voice.md`. Nothing here is an approved navigation layout, final component design or committed delivery scope. Functional decisions stay in `requirements.md`; brand decisions stay in `brand/`. Where a screen depends on an unresolved question, it is marked **Open**.

## 1. Global rules (apply to every screen)

**Visual**
- Light mode: Paper `#F6EFE3` surfaces, Ink `#2E1F1A` text, Burgundy `#7A2233` primary buttons with Paper labels. Dark mode: Night burgundy `#3A121C` surfaces, Paper text, Gold `#C99A4E` primary buttons with Ink labels.
- Gold is a small accent only; never Gold text or Gold-only icons/borders on Paper. Never Burgundy text or Burgundy-only controls on Night burgundy.
- Type: Newsreader for headings, Literata for anything people read (excerpts, manuscripts, bios), Inter for controls, labels, navigation and data. Sentence case, no all-caps.
- Rounded line icons, about 1.5–2 px at 24 px. Empty states use a flat single-colour illustration in the palette, no faces.
- No gradients, glows, drop shadows, pure white or pure black.
- Status, privacy and error states always pair colour with text and an icon.

**Behaviour and copy**
- Every string exists in Romanian and English; language is chosen explicitly and changed in Settings. Manuscript language is separate from interface language.
- No streaks, points, rankings, countdowns, inactivity guilt or "don't miss out" copy. Milestones are one quiet confirmation after a completed action.
- No humour on error, rejection or privacy screens. At most one exclamation mark per screen.
- Never say or imply paying authors, getting published, or that manuscripts are safe from copying. State only confirmed save/upload/send status; if unknown, say so and point to My manuscripts or submission status.
- Say "writers, readers, publishers", not "users" or "creators". The app is "Lisette".
- Privacy cues (who can see this) appear wherever content is shared: a lock icon plus a plain sentence.
- Reaction labels/icons are **Open**; use placeholders, not working labels as copy.

**Layout**
- Android phone first; tablets get list/detail (two-pane) layouts; web gets a wider workspace for manuscript management and publisher review (section 5).
- Minimum 48 dp touch targets, Literata 16–18 sp with ~1.6 line height for reading.
- Content requires sign-in everywhere; there are no signed-out content pages.

## 2. Navigation (proposed)

Bottom navigation on Android phone (rail on tablet, left sidebar on web), at most five items, role-aware:

| Reader / Author | Publisher |
|---|---|
| Home (followed feed) | Home (followed feed) |
| Discover (search, publishers, events map) | Submissions (inbox) |
| Library | Discover |
| Manuscripts (appears once author profile is activated) | Calls and events |
| Profile (with Notifications bell in the top bar on every tab) | Profile |

Administration is a separate restricted web area, not part of the app navigation.

## 3. Screen catalogue

Each entry: purpose · key elements · states and rules · platform. "A" = Android phone/tablet, "W" = web.

### 3.1 Access and settings

| ID | Screen | Content and appearance | Platform |

| S-06 | Settings | Language, appearance (light/dark/auto), reading theme, manuscript app lock (biometrics with phone PIN fallback), share reading patterns with authors (opt-in, off by default, two levels: standard, counted only with 10+ readers, or also when few people read; separate switch for the microphone noise level, which never records audio), blocked accounts, data export, account deletion request, notification preferences (**Open**). | A, W |

Selected shows contact-outside-Lisette note. Withdraw is also available from Selected. | A, W |
| S-30 | Sharing request | Author chooses exact synopsis/excerpt text and its audience (everyone, followers, beta-readers); shows which publishers must approve, per-publisher state (waiting / approved / refused), nothing visible to readers until all required approvals cover that exact text. Editing text resets approval. | A, W |

Status chips (text + icon + colour, never colour alone; labels follow the spec): Submitted, In review, On hold / În așteptare (with "The publisher is still considering it"), Selected by publisher (not "Accepted"; no contract wording), Rejected, Withdrawn.

Line "Based on N readers who chose to share reading patterns". Below the threshold: no shading, a plain note that patterns appear once enough readers share them. Reading context (still/moving, quiet/loud) as coarse proportions. Action "Share with a publisher" with a list of current shares. No individual readers, scores or comparisons; "Patterns, not a measure of quality." Below 10 readers, only readers who chose the no-threshold level are included. | A, W |

## 4. Core flows to prototype first in Figma

These carry the competition story; design them end-to-end before the rest.
1. First run → language → register → verify → author activation.
2. Upload PDF → preview → choose publishers → consent → per-recipient result → track status.
3. Publisher: inbox → read → On hold → select with evaluation → author sees notification.
4. Scan ISBN → book detail with linked profiles and events.
5. Map → discovery preview → unlock → collection.
6. Author shares an excerpt → publisher approval → public excerpt reader.

## 5. Platform adaptation

- **Android phone:** single column, bottom navigation, sheets for confirmation and reporting.
- **Android tablet:** navigation rail, list/detail for inbox, manuscripts and notifications.
- **Web:** sidebar; wide workspace for manuscript management and publisher review (S-20 to S-30, S-40 to S-44); map viewing and unlocked discoveries only; no ISBN scan or initial unlock.

## 6. Open items affecting screens

Reaction set and icons; reading-pattern retention and opt-out deletion (S-57); post/image/text limits; notification preferences; proximity threshold and out-of-range wording; Selected-submission withdrawal and post-selection policy changes (S-29); author/publisher section label wording and ordering; publisher settings on Android (S-14); unavailable-content wording; reviewed Romanian interface copy; logo production files; English central promise.
